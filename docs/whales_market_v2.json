    "pageContent": "Whales Market Overview\n\nWhales Market is a platform that offers various financial services, including a referral program, staking opportunities, and wallet integration. Users can engage in pre-market activities, such as buying and selling token allocations, and participate in over-the-counter (OTC) and point markets for trading tokens and points. The platform also provides a comprehensive set of additional documents, including market reports, contract audits, official links, contract addresses, brand kits, and changelogs.\n\nStaking on Whales Market\n\nBy staking $WHALES tokens, users can earn a share of the protocol's revenue, which is 60% of the fees collected from OTC markets. Stakers receive $xWHALES, a derivative token that serves two purposes: revenue sharing and collateral use in OTC markets.\n\nFee Collection and Distribution\n\nFees are collected in various assets and converted into $WHALES tokens to simplify the reward distribution. These conversions are transparent and the rewards are evenly distributed among stakers.\n\nStaking Contract Mechanics\n\nThe staking contract operates with $WHALES and $xWHALES tokens. Stakers receive $xWHALES in exchange for $WHALES, which entitles them to increasing rewards as the protocol purchases more $WHALES with generated revenue. This system enhances the value for stakers and mitigates the risk of reward dumping.\n\nWithdrawal and Tokenomics\n\nStakers can withdraw their funds at any time by converting $xWHALES back to $WHALES. While $xWHALES is tradable, there is currently no official liquidity pool for it. The staking rewards do not increase the supply of $WHALES, as they are bought from the open market. Incentive allocation emissions of $WHALES tokens are distributed with a 4-year linear vesting schedule.\n\nFor more information on the referral program and wallet linking, please refer to the respective sections of the Whales Market platform.\n\n[Note: The document has been rewritten to focus on content, excluding navigation elements and URLs.]",

The platform operates through a smart contract, allowing for secure and automated transactions where buyers can deposit funds and sellers can place their assets directly into the contract.\n\nIf your sell or buy orders are not filled by the time of the Token Generation Event (TGE), you have the option to close your offer through the dashboard. Importantly, you are not required to share your private wallet key with anyone.\n\nSellers are required to provide collateral as a guarantee that they will deliver the tokens once available. Failure to settle by the deadline results in the collateral being transferred to the buyer as compensation. Fees are charged only for closing, settling, or canceling an offer.\n\nThe Pre-Market lists assets such as pre-TGE tokens and airdrop allocations, with the security of smart contracts for both buyers and sellers. Detailed information on what occurs at TGE and the settlement rules can be found in the Settlement Rules section.\n\nIf you've filled a buy offer but haven't received your tokens, it's important to note that no further action can be taken until the TGE occurs.\n\nFor more information on technical aspects, platform fees, and other inquiries, please refer to the respective sections in the Whales Market documentation.",
